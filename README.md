# Changes needed to make certain SquadJS Plugins still work.

- [Buff's Mapvote Changes](https://github.com/Buff-oG/Galactic-Contention-squad-js-map-vote)

## How to install:
- Replace your `./squad-server/log-parser/index.js` file with the one provided.
- Add the `./squad-server/log-parser/player-connected-gc.js` and `./squad-server/log-parser/playercontroller-connected-gc.js` files.
- If I were a hoster, I would wait for SquadJS (https://github.com/Team-Silver-Sphere/SquadJS/pulls) to parse our player controllers properly since we are using a different name.
